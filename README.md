Hangman Python Project
This Hangman Python project is a command-line game that challenges players to guess a word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. It aims to provide an entertaining and interactive gaming experience while testing players' vocabulary and problem-solving skills.

Features:
Word Selection: The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list or a custom word list, offering a diverse range of word options for players to guess.

Gameplay: Players are presented with a series of dashes representing each letter in the word. They can enter a letter guess and receive feedback on whether the letter is present or not. The game keeps track of the remaining attempts, displaying a visual representation of the hangman's gallows as incorrect guesses accumulate.

Win or Lose: The game continues until the player guesses the word correctly or exhausts all the attempts. A win or lose message is displayed accordingly, and the correct word is revealed in case of a loss.

Score Tracking: The project includes a score tracker that records the number of wins and losses for each player. The scores can be saved and loaded for future gameplay sessions.

Usage:
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the hangman.py script using Python 3: python hangman.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter a letter at each prompt to make guesses.
Requirements
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine to run the game.
